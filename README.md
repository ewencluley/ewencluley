# Hi There 👋

- My name is Ewen Cluley (he/him)
- I'm a Software Engineer [@Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com) working to bring huge volumes of social and other media data to our platform.
- I love making things.
  - Sometimes that's software💻
  - Sometimes it's various electronic things 🤖
  - Sometimes it's beer 🍺
  - Sometimes it's furniture 🪚

I am fairly forgetful about the cool stuff I have made over the years (and all the garbage nonsense too) so I'm going to try and maintain a list of it here, mainly for my own benefit.

- [Half Geodesic Garden Dome](dome/)
  - I thought a rgular pergola was borring and had got chatting with a friend about Buckminster Fuller. This was the result of that conversation 
- [Garden table](garden-table/)
  - The top hexagon is a leftover from the Dome
- [Boat](boat/)
  - 10ft Pram design made on a bit of an impulse when I had neither the money nor skills to build a boat. I guess that's how you get the skills.
  - Sadly this boat fell off the roofrack of my car onto the motorway at rushhour and did not survive the experience. Luckily no one was hurt, except my heart.
- [Patio](patio/)
  - A good few weekends with a cement mixer and the help of some friends. I bought the beers after.
- [Chute](chute/)
  - A chute for getting building 3 tonnes of sand and 3 tonnes of hardcore through my house to the garden to make the patio. Saved a lot fo time and effort. One of my better ideas.
- [Planter](planter/)
  - Because I couldn't be bothered taking the earth I had dug out to level the ground for the patio to the dump.
  - This actually turned out really nice and I love it.
- [Beer](beer/)
  - Various home brew beers over the years. Some of questionable flavour, some marvelous.
- [Wedding Dress](dress/)
  - I got married once and made my wife's dress. We were happily married for many years and are now happily unmarried. 
  - The dress was cool and the bolero jacket had tartan that matched my kilt
