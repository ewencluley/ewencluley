# Hi There 👋

- My name is Ewen Cluley (he/him)
- I'm a Software Engineer [@Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com) working to bring huge volumes of social and other media data to our platform.
- I love making things.
  - Sometimes that's software💻
  - Sometimes it's various electronic things 🤖
  - Sometimes it's beer 🍺
  - Sometimes it's furniture 🪚

I am fairly forgetful about the cool stuff I have made over the years (and all the garbage nonsense too) so I'm going to try and maintain a list of it here.
