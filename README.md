# Hi There üëã

- My name is Ewen Cluley (he/him)
- I'm a Software Engineer [@Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com) working to bring huge volumes of social and other media data to our platform.
- I love making things.
  - Sometimes that's softwareüíª
  - Sometimes it's various electronic things ü§ñ
  - Sometimes it's beer üç∫
  - Sometimes it's furniture ü™ö

I am fairly forgetful about the cool stuff I have made over the years (and all the garbage nonsense too) so I'm going to try and maintain a list of it here, mainly for my own benefit.
Not an exhaustive list, just the stuff I have photos for

- [Half Geodesic Garden Dome](dome/)
  - I thought a rgular pergola was borring and had got chatting with a friend about Buckminster Fuller. This was the result of that conversation 
- [Garden table](garden-table/)
  - The top hexagon is a leftover from the Dome
- [Boat](boat/)
  - 10ft Pram design made on a bit of an impulse when I had neither the money nor skills to build a boat. I guess that's how you get the skills.
  - Sadly this boat fell off the roofrack of my car onto the motorway at rushhour and did not survive the experience. Luckily the incident did not result in any injuries, except to my heart.
- [Patio](patio/)
  - A good few weekends with a cement mixer and the help of some friends. I bought the beers after.
- [Chute](chute/)
  - A chute for getting building 3 tonnes of sand and 3 tonnes of hardcore through my house to the garden to make the patio. Saved a lot fo time and effort. One of my better ideas.
- [Planter](planter/)
  - Because I couldn't be bothered taking the earth I had dug out to level the ground for the patio to the dump.
  - This actually turned out really nice and I love it.
- [Wedding Dress](dress/)
  - I got married once and made my wife's dress. We were happily married for many years and are now happily unmarried. 
  - The dress was cool and the bolero jacket had tartan details that matched my kilt
- [The Brewen Brewley](brewen-brewley/)
  - Mash tun for home brewing similar to a [Grainfather](https://shop.grainfather.com/uk/g30v3-brewing-system.html) because I was too poor to buy a Grainfather.
  - I had to be decomissioned after melting through it's own electric cables and almost electrocuting my friend Sam.
  - I now brew with a proper grainfather and everyone is happier and safer for it.
- [Beer](beer/)
  - Various home brew beers over the years. Some of questionable flavour, some marvelous.
- [Transforming Coffee Table](coffee-table/)
  - Coffee table, TV dinner table and board games table all in one. I love this and use it loads. It needs a sand down and re-varnish
- Murphy Beds [MK2](murphy-bed-mk2/) and [MK3](murphy-bed-mk3/)
  - I got a little obsessed with murphy beds over the span of quite a few years.
  - Thankfully the evidence of the monstrosity that was MK1 had been lost to the mists of time. I think it was probably the first thing I ever built out of wood with just a jigsaw and electric screwdriver. Shudder.
- [Campervan Bed](camp-bed/) for my 2010 reg [Citreon Berlingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_Berlingo)
  - Folds out to create a good size sleeping platform. Made of plywood.
  - Beats sleeping in a tent.
- [RadioPi](https://github.com/ewencluley/radiopi) - a radio alarm clock that plays a random internet radio station with the alarm
  - I got bored of the same breakfast show every morning so built this to try and spice things up
  - Unfortunately a lot of the urls I had coded in no longer work.
